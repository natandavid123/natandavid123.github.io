                    <p>During my intern period as an application tester, one of my project is to testing a anti money-laundering based development website. My responsbility in this project include performing test on bulking screening, data output, data scanning, and notification on Anti Money-Laundry based development website. Uploading a bulk of data from excel to the website and checking if there are any missed data that didnt uploaded correctly according to test plan. The uploaded data then checked again, to make sure the output is the same as in the excel and the data will then be scanned. The website should pop up a notification in case one of the data from the customer is suspicious or in a black list data, and the notification will also be checked to show properly the same as the written scenario in test plan. All the steps were documented and recorded to see how long the time needed for each step took.</p>
